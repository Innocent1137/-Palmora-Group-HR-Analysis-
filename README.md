## üßÆ DAX Expressions Used

```dax
Gender Pay Gap = 
VAR MaleAvg = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Palmoria Group emp-data'[Salary]), 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Gender] = "Male")
VAR FemaleAvg = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Palmoria Group emp-data'[Salary]), 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Gender] = "Female")
RETURN DIVIDE(MaleAvg - FemaleAvg, MaleAvg, 0)

Salary Band = 
VAR band = FLOOR('Palmoria Group emp-data'[Salary], 10000)
RETURN FORMAT(band, "$#,##0") & " - " & FORMAT(band + 9999, "$#,##0")

Manufacturing Below Threshold = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('Palmoria Group emp-data'),
    FILTER(
        'Palmoria Group emp-data',
        'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Department] = "Manufacturing" &&
        'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Salary] < 90000
    )
)

Bonus % (Based on Rating & Department) = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Rating] = "Very Poor", LOOKUPVALUE('Bonus Rules'[Very Poor], 'Bonus Rules'[Department], 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Department]),
    'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Rating] = "Poor", LOOKUPVALUE('Bonus Rules'[Poor], 'Bonus Rules'[Department], 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Department]),
    'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Rating] = "Average", LOOKUPVALUE('Bonus Rules'[Average], 'Bonus Rules'[Department], 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Department]),
    'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Rating] = "Good", LOOKUPVALUE('Bonus Rules'[Good], 'Bonus Rules'[Department], 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Department]),
    'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Rating] = "Very Good", LOOKUPVALUE('Bonus Rules'[Very Good], 'Bonus Rules'[Department], 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Department])
)

Bonus Amount = 
'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Salary] * 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Bonus %]

Total Pay = 
'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Salary] + 'Palmoria Group emp-data'[Bonus Amount]

Bonus Paid (Measure) = 
SUM('Palmoria Group emp-data'[Bonus Amount])

Total Pay Paid = 
SUM('Palmoria Group emp-data'[Total Pay])

```

## üìä Power BI Features Used

- Custom DAX: `Bonus %`, `Bonus Amount`, `Gender Pay Gap`
- Relationships between employee data and bonus rules
- Matrix, Card, Column, Pie, and Table visuals
- Slicers: Region, Gender, Department, Rating

---

## ‚úÖ Business Insights

- Gender pay gap exists in [Department]
- Some manufacturing staff fall below regulatory pay
- Employees with "Very Good" ratings received up to 10% bonuses

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Integrate time-based data for trend analysis.
   - Include job roles or seniority levels for a deeper look into compensation structure.
   - Develop automated flags for regulatory compliance and pay equity violations.
---

## üõ† Tools

- Power BI Desktop
- Excel (for preprocessing)
- GitHub (for version control & documentation)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Limitations

1. **No Historical Data**  
   The analysis is based on a single snapshot of employee data, limiting trend or time-based insights.

2. **No Job Title or Level**  
   The dataset lacks role or seniority information, which restricts fair comparisons of salaries across employees.

3. **Simplified Bonus Logic**  
   Bonus percentages are applied uniformly based on department and rating, without adjustments for tenure or manager input.

4. **Assumed Data Accuracy**  
   All insights assume that the provided data is complete, clean, and correctly categorized (e.g., ratings, departments).

5. **Missing Cost of Living Adjustments**  
   Salaries are compared across regions without accounting for location-based differences in living expenses or local market rates.
